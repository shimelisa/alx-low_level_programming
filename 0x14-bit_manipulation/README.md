# C - Bit manipulation

This project covered topics on how to manipulate bits and use the bitwise operators `>>`, `<<`, `&`, `|`, and `^` in C.

* `bitwise operator`: is operator that compares value bit by bit and it includes:

   * `&`: AND `bitwise binary` operator
   * `|`: OR `bitwise binary` operator --> A OR B = Including Boxth (A or B or both are 1)
   * `~`: NOT `bitwise unary` operator
   * `<<`: Left Shift `bitwise binary` operator
   * `>>`: Right Shift `bitwise binary` operator
   * `^`: XOR `bitwise binary` operator --> A XOR B = Excluding BOTH (Either A is 1 or Bis 1)

## Tests File :heavy_check_mark:
